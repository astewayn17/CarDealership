## Interesting Code
**Method to read the dealership and vehicle information:**
One of the more interesting parts of my code is how it reads vehicle and dealership data from a CSV file, formats it, 
and stores it into an `ArrayList` as structured objects. This approach allows the program to manage inventory without 
relying on a database, demonstrating practical file handling and object-oriented design.
```java
public Dealership getDealership() {
        Dealership dealership = null;
        try {
            FileReader fileReadBoi = new FileReader("src/main/resources/inventory.csv");
            BufferedReader buffReadBoi = new BufferedReader(fileReadBoi);
            String line = buffReadBoi.readLine();
            if (line != null) {
                String[] dealershipSegments = line.split("\\|");
                dealership = new Dealership(dealershipSegments[0], dealershipSegments[1], dealershipSegments[2]);
            }
            while ((line = buffReadBoi.readLine()) != null) {
                String[] segments = line.split("\\|");
                int vin = Integer.parseInt(segments[0]);
                int year = Integer.parseInt(segments[1]);
                String make = segments[2];
                String model = segments[3];
                String type = segments[4];
                String color = segments[5];
                int odometer = Integer.parseInt(segments[6]);
                double price = Double.parseDouble(segments[7]);
                Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle(vin, year, make, model, type, color, odometer, price);
                dealership.addVehicle(vehicle);
            }
        }
        catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error reading dealership file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        return dealership;
    }
